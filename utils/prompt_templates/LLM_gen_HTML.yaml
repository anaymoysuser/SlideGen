  INSTRUCTIONS
  ================================================================
  1. Carefully read the Markdown in ``document_markdown``.
  2. Design a full-page academic conference slides in HTML + CSS:
     • Include a prominent header with title, authors, and affiliations.  
     • Break content into logical sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusions, etc.).  
     • Provide clear, informative text summaries.  
     • Embed relevant figures and tables, neatly arranged and aligned.  
     • Accurately represent key findings, methods, and conclusions.  
     • Ensure the layout is engaging, easy to follow, and visually attractive.  
     • Include all essential slides elements commonly found at scientific conferences.
  3. Write complete HTML code (with inline or embedded CSS) that, when rendered,
     produces the slides layout.
  5. The slides width should be {{slides_width}}px and height should be {{slides_height}}px.
  4. **Output only** a JSON object with a single key ``HTML``, whose value is
     the entire HTML code for the slides.
