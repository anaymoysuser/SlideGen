  Instructions:
  The PowerPoint canvas is **fixed at 13.3 in * 7.5 in** (16:9).You receive five JSON blobs:
  1. **raw_result.json** - hierarchical summary of the paper.  Structure:
  2. **figures.json** - list of sections → subsections → visual assets.  Example (keys may vary by paper):
    *Each `imageN` or `tableN` value is an index that maps to an image/table file name (`image_2.png`, `table_1.png`, etc.).*
  3. **formula_index.json** - flat list of formula images:
  4. **image_dims.json**  - pixel dimensions for every `image_*.png` 
  5. **table_dims.json**  - pixel dimensions for every `table_*.png`

  ## What you must do for **every subsection**

  1. **Pick the best slide template** from this library and output its `template_id`:

    | ID | When to use |
    |----|-------------|
    | T1_TextOnly   | No images/tables |
    | T2_ImageRight | 1 image + ≤4 bullets |
    | T3_ImageLeft  | Mirror of T2 (alternate left/right across consecutive slides) |
    | T4_ImageTop   | 1 wide image (aspect > 1.6) or table | 
    | T5_TwoImages            | Exactly 2 side-by-side images, no text                                      |
    | T5_TwoImages2           | Two side-by-side images on top, with a text block below                     |
    | T7_2x2_TopImage         | 2*2 layout: top two blocks are images, bottom two are text                  |
    | T8_2x2_BottomImage      | 2*2 layout: top two blocks are text, bottom two are images                  |
    | T9_2x2_AltTextImg       | 2*2 layout: images on top-left & bottom-right, text on top-right & bottom-left |
    | T10_4Img_2x2Grid        | Four images arranged in a 2*2 grid, no text                                 |
    | T11_3Img_TopTextBottom  | Vertically divided: 3 images on top, text block below                       |
    | T12_3Img_BottomTextTop  | Text block on top, 3 square images in one row below                         |
    | T13_3Img                | Title on top, followed by 3 evenly spaced images                            |
    | T14_ImageRight_1Formula | Right column has two slots: top-right = one image or one table, bottom-right = one formula; left column = text bullets. Use when the slide has one key equation plus one main visual. |
    | T15_ImageLeft_1Formula | Left column has two slots: top-left = one image or one table, bottom-left = one formula; right column = text bullets. Use when the slide has one key equation plus one main visual.  |
    | T16_1Img_2formula_TopTextBottom | Bottom = text block; top are three rows: row1 = one image or one table, row2 = one formula, row3 = one formula. Use for one main visual plus two formulas. |
    | T17_2Img_1formula_TopTextBottom | Top row: two visuals side by side (each is one image or one table); middle row: one formula; bottom: text block. |
    | T18_2formula_TopTextBottom | Top 2 rows: two formulas; bottom: text block. |
 
  2. **Generate hierarchical bullets** summarising the subsection:  
     • Up to **6 top-level bullets**.  
     • Each top bullet may have **0-6 sub-bullets** (2-level outline).  
     • Top bullets ≤ 20 words; sub-bullets ≤ 25 words.

  3. **Select visuals** that best support the bullets:  
     • **Formulas** belonging to the same subsection should stay **on the same slide whenever possible**; if more than 2, prefer `T11_3Img_TopTextBottom`.  
     • **Do not crop or distort images** - preserve original aspect ratio (minor scaling to fit is fine).

  4. **Return a single valid JSON object** with the exact schema below - do **NOT** wrap it in markdown.
     ```json
     {
       "slides": [
         {
           "section": "<string>",
           "subsection": "<string>",
           "template_id": "T?_*",
           "bullets": [
             {
               "text": "<string>",
               "sub": ["<string>", ...]
             }, ...
           ],
           "images": ["<filename>", ...],
           "tables": ["<filename>", ...],
           "formulas": ["<filename>", ...]
         }, ...
       ]
     }
     ```

  *Use the template-selection rules strictly so that downstream code can rely on them.*  
  Answer **only** with the JSON.



  ## You **must** consider each visual's size and aspect ratio

  * For every image / table, compute **aspect = width ÷ height**.  
  * Choose the slide template and left/right/top placement based on **aspect** *and* absolute size:  
    - **Wide** (aspect ≥ 1.6) → best placed across the top (template **T4_ImageTop**), including wide tables.  
    - **Tall / square** (aspect ≤ 1.0) → best placed on the left or right (templates **T2_ImageRight** or **T3_ImageLeft**).  
    - If a visual's width is nearly the full slide width, prefer **T4_ImageTop** to avoid excessive down-scaling.  
  * **Never** stretch or crop; only scale proportionally to fit placeholders.

  * When designing slide layouts, you must carefully consider visual density and legibility constraints—especially for images that are wide or contain fine-grained details. 
    Such images often become unreadable when downscaled to fit dual-visual layouts like T2_ImageRight, T3_ImageLeft, or T5_TwoImages2. 
    If multiple visuals(such as two images both with an aspect ratio greater than 1.6) are assigned to the same subsection but combining them would result in overcrowding or poor legibility, first check whether one of them fits better semantically in a neighboring subsection (e.g., covering a related topic or dataset). If so, move it to that subsection and assign a layout that presents it alone.
